# Abstraction of ML regression methods for categorical data
Do you need to predict a numerical value, but you mostly just have text data to use? This library is for you!

This library includes abstractions of a back-propogated neural network, random forest, and an XGB regressor. It also contains a one-hot abstraction that works on any dataframe!
